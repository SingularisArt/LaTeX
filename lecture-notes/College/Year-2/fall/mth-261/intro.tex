Lectures notes from the course \MyTitle, given by professor Ian Nicolas at the \faculty~at \location~in the academic year \academicyear, in the \term. This course covers linear systems, vectors in n-space, vector space properties of n-space, and matrix algebra, including eigenspaces. Credit for the material in these notes are loosely based on professor Ian's notes and from the \href{https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/linear-algebra-and-its-applications/P200000006235}{Linear Algebra and Its Applications} textbook. The credit for the typesetting is my own.
