\subsection{Bijection Between Three Sets}
\label{sub_sec:bijection_between_three_sets}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets. If $\vert A \vert = \vert B \vert$ and $\vert B \vert = \vert C \vert$, then $\vert A \vert = \vert C \vert$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\vert A \vert = \vert B \vert$ and $\vert B \vert = \vert C \vert$,
  then $\exists$ bijection from $A \to B$ and bijection from $B \to C$.
\end{proof}
